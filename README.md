[wordplay](https://github.com/BMariscal/intermediate_python/tree/master/wordplay): Used list comprehension and string slicing
to find the longest palindrome. Learned about and utilized the sets data structure. Performed timing measurements and basic profiling to understand code efficiency. Learned about printing with string formating. 

[sonnets](https://github.com/BMariscal/intermediate_python/tree/master/sonnets): Practiced reading code and how to clean up and structure data source to meet my needs. Learned how to process data into the desired format (e.g, how to create a one word per line wordlist from text). Learned about Big O notation of lists vs. dictionaries(O(n) vs O(1)) and compared script/data structure efficiency using the time module. 

[jeopardy](https://github.com/BMariscal/intermediate_python/tree/master/jeopardy): Learned how to interact with databases. Learned how to make SQL queries. Used SQLite. 

[plotting](https://github.com/BMariscal/intermediate_python/tree/master/plotting): Learned how to plot data using pyplot. Matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. 

[scraper](https://github.com/BMariscal/intermediate_python/tree/master/scraper): Used BeautifulSoup and urllib to scrape NASA's apod(Astronomy Picture of the Day ) website for pictures.
