What do Scrabble cheaters, Shakespearean sonnets, Twitter, and the Astronomy
Picture of the Day have to do with Python software programming? For software
impresario Jessica McKellar, they’re playful tools for teaching intermediate-level
Python programming techniques. During her time as an organizer of the Boston Python
User Group (one of the world’s largest Python groups), she taught hundreds of Python
wannabees to happily program like pros. She uses that experience to benefit the next
generation of Pythonistas in this follow-up to her widely popular Introduction to Python video.
